# LaunchCV - 7-Day MVP Project Plan üöÄ

## Project Overview
**Mission:** Build LaunchCV, a modern resume builder that helps professionals launch their careers with precision-crafted, tailored resumes.

**Timeline:** 7 days
**Core Workflow:** Import ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí Tailor ‚Üí Launch (export)
**Brand Theme:** Rocket ships, launch sequences, mission control aesthetics

---

## üîÑ Git Workflow & Repository Strategy

### Repository Structure
- **GitHub Repository:** `launch-cv` (main project repository)
- **Branch Strategy:**
  - `main` - Production environment (protected, requires PR reviews)
  - `staging` - Pre-production testing and deployment
  - `develop` - Main development integration branch
  - `feature/*` - Individual feature development branches

### Daily Git Workflow
1. **Start of Day:** Create feature branch from `develop`
2. **During Development:** Regular commits with descriptive messages
3. **End of Day:** Merge feature branch to `develop`, push to remote
4. **Major Milestones:** Create PR from `develop` to `staging` for testing

### Commit Message Convention
```
type(scope): description

feat(import): add PDF parsing functionality
fix(ui): resolve mobile responsive issues
docs(readme): update setup instructions
style(components): apply launch theme colors
```

### Branch Protection Rules
- `main` branch requires PR reviews
- `staging` branch requires passing CI/CD checks
- No direct commits to `main` or `staging`
- All features developed in feature branches
