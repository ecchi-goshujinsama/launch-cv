- Use professional grays for text and backgrounds

**Visual Theme:** Rocket ships, upward arrows, launch sequences, mission control aesthetics

**Terminology:**
- Import = "Pre-flight Data Import"
- Building = "Mission Control"
- Export = "Launch Sequence"
- Success = "Career Launched!"
- Errors = "Mission Control Alert"

## MVP Features (Week 1)
1. **Resume Import System** - PDF/Word/text import with parsing
2. **Resume Builder** - Form-based editor with live preview
3. **Templates** - 3-5 professional, ATS-friendly designs
4. **PDF Export** - High-quality resume output
5. **Job Tailoring** - Basic keyword highlighting
6. **Local Storage** - Browser persistence
7. **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach

## Key Components to Build
- `LaunchButton` - Primary action buttons with rocket animations
- `MissionProgress` - Progress indicators with countdown aesthetics
- `PreFlightCheck` - Validation and error handling
- `ResumePreview` - Live preview with template switching
- `ImportWizard` - File upload and data extraction
- `ExportSequence` - PDF generation with launch animations

## Data Models
```typescript
interface Resume {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  templateId: string;
  personalInfo: PersonalInfo;
  sections: ResumeSection[];
  metadata: ResumeMetadata;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface PersonalInfo {
  fullName: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  location: string;
  linkedin?: string;
  website?: string;
  summary: string;
}
```

## Development Priorities
1. **Speed First** - Complete resume in < 10 minutes
2. **Mobile Ready** - Responsive on all devices
3. **Brand Consistency** - Every interaction feels like a launch
4. **Data Safety** - Never lose user progress
5. **Professional Output** - Print-ready PDF quality

## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript strictly with proper interfaces
- Follow React best practices and hooks rules
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use Zod for runtime validation
- Apply consistent naming: PascalCase components, camelCase variables
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use Tailwind classes, avoid custom CSS where possible
- Component files should be kebab-case: `launch-button.tsx`

## Performance Targets
- Bundle size: < 200KB (gzipped)
- Time to Interactive: < 3s
- First Contentful Paint: < 2s
- PDF Generation: < 2s

## File Parsing Requirements
- **PDF:** Use pdf-parse or PDF-lib for text extraction
- **Word:** Use mammoth.js for .docx files
- **Text Processing:** Regex patterns for emails, phones, dates
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallback to manual entry

## Template Requirements
1. **Classic Professional** - Traditional layout, ATS-friendly
2. **Modern Minimal** - Clean, contemporary design
3. **Executive** - Bold header, premium feel
4. **Technical** - Skills-focused, GitHub integration
